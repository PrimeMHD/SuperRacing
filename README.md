# SuperRacing
A car racing game run on Nexy4 FPGA, written in Verilog HDL.
This project is implemented using digital logic circuits.

##Relative Project:
[MIPS_SuperRacing_SingleCycleCPU](https://github.com/SuperAmi3401/MIPS_SuperRacing_SingleCycleCPU)
Having the same functions, but implemented in a more advanced way.
Game program is written in mips assembly, running on a single-cycle mips cpu, which is written in Verilog HDL by SuperAmi3401.
